  primary: >
    Standing since 1882, the Cathedral of Saint Peter-in-Chains, with its
    commanding 200-foot steeple, is one of Downtown&nbsp;Peterborough&apos;s
    most prominent landmarks.
    This historic church stands as a clear reminder to the Christian roots of
    our city, the presence of God in our community, and the faith-centric path
    to&nbsp;its&nbsp;future.
  secondary: >
    Established in&nbsp;1981 and registered as a non-profit charitable
    corporation in the Province&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ontario, the core mission of
    The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund is to ensure the
    Cathedral&nbsp;of Saint&nbsp;Peter-in-Chains,
    this beautiful reminder of our Catholic heritage,
    endures for future generations, by supporting the physical maintenance
    of the Cathedral building and its grounds.
    Donations are held in perpetuity, and invested for the sole purpose to earn
    interest. The interest generated then becomes the funds disbursed to
    support its&nbsp;mission.

        generous individuals like you, as well as from organizations

        When you donate, your gift becomes part of The&nbsp;Fund&apos;s

        invested** by professional financial&nbsp;managers.

        Our Board of Directors consists of individuals with decades of
        experience in business who volunteer their time and expertise towards
        this worthwhile endeavour. We place special emphasis on wise
        stewardship to ensure the long-term viability of the
        The&nbsp;Fund in support of its&nbsp;core&nbsp;mission.

      text: |
        **The&nbsp;Fund&apos;s endowment earns interest**.
        This interest&mdash;and only the interest&mdash;is used in the
        fulfilment of the mission&#x3A;
        The improvement and preservation of the physical property of
        the&nbsp;Cathedral.

        Since its founding in 1981, The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund has
        contributed to finance numerous projects at the Cathedral,
        including the replacement of carpets and pews, THIS AND THAT, and
        recently the installation of a modern light and sound&nbsp;system.
        These critical improvements are made possible by you, and
        help the Cathedral continue to fulfil its role as a faith centre
        for not only its own parishioners, but the surrounding&nbsp;community.
