  title: What is the Perpetual Fund?
  primary: >
    The Cathedral of Saint Peter-in-Chains,
    with its commanding 150-foot steeple,
    is one of Downtown&nbsp;Peterborough&apos;s most prominent landmarks.
    This historic church, which was completed in 1838, stands as a clear
    reminder to the Christian roots of our city,
    the presence of God in our community, and
    the faith-centric path to&nbsp;its&nbsp;future.
  secondary: >
    Established in&nbsp;1981 and registered as a not-for-profit charitable
    corporation in the Province&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ontario, the core mission of
    The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund is to ensure the
    Cathedral&nbsp;of Saint&nbsp;Peter-in-Chains,
    this beautiful reminder of our Catholic heritage,
    endures for future generations, by supporting the physical maintenance
    of the Cathedral building and its grounds.
    Donations are held in perpetuity and invested to earn interest.
    The interest generated then becomes the funds disbursed to
    support the&nbsp;mission.

        As a charitable organization, The&nbsp;Fund invites donations from
        generous individuals like you, as well as from organizations
        considering their social responsibility allocations.
        Your donations fund an investment in our cultural heritage and our
        community&apos;s&nbsp;future.

        The&nbsp;Fund accepts donations in multiple forms.
        Most prefer one-time or ongoing monetary donations, but donors
        may also remember The&nbsp;Fund via bequests, life insurance policies,
        annuities, or gifts of property. Donations in-memoriam are also a way
        to honour not only a treasured friend or loved one, but also the
        presence of the Cathedral in the lives of so many.
        All donations are tax-deductible. See below for ways
        to&nbsp;[donate](#howtodonate).
    - title: Investment
      icon: 2
      text: |
        When you donate, your gift becomes part of The&nbsp;Fund&apos;s
        endowment. This capital is then **carefully and conservatively
        invested** by a professional financial&nbsp;advisor under the
        direction of The&nbsp;Fund&apos;s Investment&nbsp;Committee.

        Our Board of Directors consists of individuals with decades of
        experience in business who volunteer their time and expertise towards
        this worthwhile endeavour. We place special emphasis on wise
        stewardship to ensure the long-term viability of the
        The&nbsp;Fund in support of its&nbsp;mission.

        The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund undergoes thorough audits annually by an
        independent public accounting firm to ensure full compliance with all
        government and tax&nbsp;regulations.

      text: |
        **The&nbsp;Fund&apos;s endowment earns interest**.
        This interest&mdash;and only the interest&mdash;is used in the
        fulfilment of the mission&#x3A;
        The improvement and preservation of
        the building and grounds of the&nbsp;Cathedral.

        Since its founding in 1981, The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund has
        contributed to and financed numerous projects at the Cathedral,
        including the replacement of doors and installation of washrooms
        at the main entrance, the carpeting of the Cathedral,
        new boilers for the building&apos;s heating system, upgrades to the
        light and sound system, and new eavestroughs. We also financed a recent
        engineering study costing $10,000 for future restoration&nbsp;projects.

        Since 2000, The&nbsp;Fund has contributed over $420,000 to
        improvement projects. These critical projects are made possible by you,
        and help the Cathedral continue to fulfil its role as a faith centre
        for not only its own parishioners, but the surrounding&nbsp;community.

      title: Fixed-income investments

      text: |
        Fixed-income investments, including annuities (e.g.,&nbsp;GICs),
        stock dividends, and bonds, offer two options which can benefit
        our&nbsp;mission.

        The **interest earned may be assigned** to the benefit of the
        The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund as recurring monetary gifts.
        For those having the financial freedom to offer the cash flow on these
        investments, this can be an excellent way to contribute to the steady
        growth of The&nbsp;Fund&apos;s&nbsp;endowment.

        Secondly, while living or as a remembrance in a bequest or
        for a loved one in memoriam, **title to a fixed-income investment
        may be transferred** to the The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund.
        Such generosity significantly adds to the value of the endowment and
        therefore the interest generated in&nbsp;perpetuity for the benefit of
        the&nbsp;Cathedral.

      title: Life insurance

      text: |
        Life insurance policies offer donors the option to gift The&nbsp;Fund
        in substantial ways. Donors having sufficient financial freedom and
        alternative coverage may choose to **name the
        The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund as a beneficiary** on
        life&nbsp;insurance&nbsp;policies.

        We stress such gifts as appropriate only for
        those with the freedom to offer this generosity. For those having
        otherwise fulfilled their duties and obligations to family and
        loved ones, we would be honoured to speak with you should you be
        considering this type of gift to The&nbsp;Fund.

        In addition to monetary amounts and liquid assets, The&nbsp;Fund
        accepts **donations of physical properties, such as real&nbsp;estate or
        other hard&nbsp;assets**, including precious metals, jewelry, vehicles,
        or any marketable&nbsp;asset.
        Such gifts to The Fund can help grow the endowment substantively,
        for which your name, or the name of someone beloved in memoriam,
        will be written into a special section in our Memorial&nbsp;Book.

        We stress the importance of the donor&apos;s
        fulfilment of all other duties and obligations to family and loved ones
        with respect to the consideration of these types of gifts.
        We graciously ask that you contact us should you be considering a gift
        of any type of physical&nbsp;property.
