  title: What is The Perpetual Fund?
  primary: >
    [The Cathedral of St&nbsp;Peter-in-Chains](https://stpeterspeterborough.ca){:target="_blank"},
    with its commanding 150-foot steeple,
    is one of Downtown&nbsp;Peterborough&apos;s most prominent landmarks.
    This historic church, which was completed in 1838, stands as a clear
    reminder to the Christian roots of our city,
    the presence of God in our community, and
    the faith-centric path to&nbsp;its&nbsp;future.
  secondary: >
    Established in&nbsp;1981 and registered as a not-for-profit charitable
    corporation in the Province&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ontario, the core mission of
    The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund is to ensure the
    Cathedral&nbsp;of St&nbsp;Peter-in-Chains,
    this beautiful reminder of our Catholic heritage,
    endures for future generations, by supporting the physical maintenance
    of the Cathedral building and its grounds.
    Donations are held in perpetuity and invested to earn interest.
    The earnings and interest then become the money used to support
    the&nbsp;mission.

        As a charitable organization, The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund invites
        donations from generous individuals like you, as well as from
        organizations considering their social responsibility allocations.
        Your donations fund an investment in our cultural heritage and our
        community&apos;s&nbsp;future.

        The&nbsp;Fund accepts donations in multiple forms.
        Most prefer one-time or recurring monetary donations, but we also
        accept life insurance policies, annuities, or gifts of property.
        Donors may also remember The&nbsp;Fund in their&nbsp;**Wills**.

        We encourage donations at any time **in memoriam** for those we knew or
        loved, whether for someone who died recently or we knew in times past.
        Donations made in memoriam honour not only a treasured friend or loved
        one, but also the presence of the Cathedral in the lives of
        so&nbsp;many.

        All donations are tax-deductible. See below for ways
        to&nbsp;[donate](#howtodonate).
    - title: Investment
      icon: 2
      text: |
        When you donate, your gift becomes part of The&nbsp;Fund&apos;s
        endowment. This capital is then **carefully and conservatively
        invested** by a professional financial&nbsp;advisor under the
        direction of The&nbsp;Fund&apos;s Investment&nbsp;Committee.

        Our Board of Directors consists of individuals with decades of
        experience in business who volunteer their time and expertise towards
        this worthwhile endeavour. We place special emphasis on wise
        stewardship to ensure the long-term viability of the
        The&nbsp;Fund in support of its&nbsp;mission.

        The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund undergoes thorough audits annually by an
        independent public accounting firm to ensure full compliance with all
        governmental regulations prior to submission of its tax&nbsp;return.
    - title: Interest generation
      icon: 3
      text: |
        **The&nbsp;Fund&apos;s endowment earns interest**.
        The interest&mdash;and only the interest&mdash;is used in the
        fulfilment of the mission&#x3A;
        The preservation and maintenance of
        the building and grounds of the&nbsp;Cathedral.

        Since its founding in 1981, The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund has
        contributed to and financed numerous projects at the Cathedral,
        including the restoration of all exterior doors, installation of
        washrooms at the main entrance, the carpeting of the Cathedral,
        new boilers for the building&apos;s heating system, upgrades to the
        light and sound system, and new eavestroughs. The&nbsp;Fund also
        financed a recent architectural/engineering study of the Cathedral to
        determine the basis and priority of any future restoration&nbsp;work.

        Since 2000, The&nbsp;Fund has contributed over $420,000 to
        improvement projects. These critical projects are made possible by you,
        and help the Cathedral continue to fulfil its role as a faith centre
        for not only its own parishioners, but the surrounding&nbsp;community.

        Please consider a recurring **pre-authorized giving&nbsp;plan** through

        monthly&nbsp;basis.

        Simply complete our **Pre-Authorized Giving&nbsp;Plan&nbsp;form**,
        available [online](/forms/perpetualfund-preauthorized.pdf) or

        Fixed-income investments, including annuities (e.g.,&nbsp;GICs),
        stock dividends, and bonds, offer two options which can benefit
        our&nbsp;mission.

        The **interest earned may be assigned** to the benefit of the
        The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund as recurring monetary gifts.
        For those having the financial freedom to offer the cash flow on these
        investments, this can be an excellent way to contribute to the steady
        growth of The&nbsp;Fund&apos;s&nbsp;endowment.

        Secondly, while living or as a remembrance in a bequest or
        for a loved one in memoriam, **title to a fixed-income investment
        may be transferred** to the The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund.
        Such generosity significantly adds to the value of the endowment and
        therefore the interest generated in&nbsp;perpetuity for the benefit of
        the&nbsp;Cathedral.

        Please speak with us if you are considering this
        form&nbsp;of&nbsp;giving.

      title: Life insurance
      icon: handshake
      text: |
        Life insurance policies offer donors the option to gift The&nbsp;Fund
        in substantial ways. Donors having sufficient financial freedom and
        alternative coverage may choose to **name the
        The&nbsp;Perpetual&nbsp;Fund as a beneficiary** on
        life&nbsp;insurance&nbsp;policies.

        We stress such gifts as appropriate only for those with the freedom to
        offer this generosity. For those having otherwise fulfilled their
        duties and obligations to family and loved ones, we would be honoured
        to speak with you should you be considering this type of gift to
        The&nbsp;Fund.

        In addition to monetary amounts and liquid assets, The&nbsp;Fund
        accepts **donations of physical properties, such as real&nbsp;estate or
        other hard&nbsp;assets**, including precious metals, jewelry, vehicles,
        or any marketable&nbsp;asset.
        Such gifts to The Fund can help grow the endowment substantively,
        for which your name, or the name of someone beloved in memoriam,
        will be written into a special section in our Memorial&nbsp;Book.

        We stress the importance of the donor&apos;s fulfilment of all other
        duties and obligations to family and loved ones with respect to the
        consideration of these types of gifts.
        We graciously ask that you contact us should you be considering a gift
        of any type of physical&nbsp;property.

        who has recently passed away or for someone remembered from times
        past, **a donation in&nbsp;memoriam of a cherished friend or
        loved&nbsp;one is a remembrance that will last in&nbsp;perpetuity**.

        If you are so moved to donate in&nbsp;memoriam, please
        include information concerning the person's name with your donation or
        speak to us directly. We will be honoured to include that person in the
