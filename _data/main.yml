        **Donations come from generous individuals and organizations**
        wishing to invest in our cultural heritage and
        our community&apos;s&nbsp;future.

        The Fund accepts donations in multiple forms.
        In addition to one-time and regular monetary donations,
        donors may also remember the Fund via bequests,
        by naming the Fund as a beneficiary on life insurance
        policies or annuities, or through gifts of property.
        All donations are tax-deductible.

        When you donate, your gift is held in perpetuity.
        The value of your gift becomes part of the Fund&apos;s endowment.
        **This capital is carefully managed&nbsp;and&nbsp;invested**.

        Our Board of Directors oversees the endowment through careful
        management of an investment portfolio in accordance with the
        Fund&apos;s mission.
        We undergo thorough audits annually by an independent public accounting
        firm to ensure the&nbsp;Fund is thoroughly compliant with all
        government and tax&nbsp;regulations.

        **The endowment earns interest**.
        The interest&mdash;and only the interest&mdash;is used to fulfil
        the mission&#x3A; The repair and improvement needs of the
        physical property of the&nbsp;Cathedral.

        The Perpetual&nbsp;Fund has helped finance numerous projects, including
        the replacement of carpets and pews, new automatic shoe-shine
        equipment, the opening of a hair salon and tea shop, and
        more recently the installation of a modern light and sound&nbsp;system.
